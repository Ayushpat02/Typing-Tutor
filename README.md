# Typing-Tutor
• Developed a typing tutor that allowed the user to spell commonly misspelled words that were stored in a vector, type random words from a given dictionary from file input, display random words from the dictionary that used the random seed generator, and look up a word using binary search.

• Utilized the built-in file input functions, vectors, functions made for the program, vector functions, and binary search.

• Focused on both aspects of the front and back end, where the information was displayed to the user, while the functionality was created for the general program.
